1|chunk|pyr 1 ]apelin-13 is the predominant apelin peptide isoform in the human cardiovascular system and plasma. to date, few studies have investigated [pyr 1 ]apelin-13 metabolism in vivo in rats with no studies examining its stability in humans. We therefore aimed to develop an Lc-MS/MS method for detection and quantification of intact [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 and have used this method to identify the metabolites generated in vivo in humans. [pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (135 nmol/min) was infused into six healthy human volunteers for 120 minutes and blood collected at time 0 and 120 minutes after infusion. Plasma was extracted in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride and analysed by Lc-MS/MS. Here we report a highly sensitive, robust and reproducible method for quantification of intact [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 and its metabolites in human plasma. Using this method, we showed that the circulating concentration of intact peptide was 58.3  10.5 ng/ml after 120 minutes infusion. We demonstrated for the first time that in humans, [pyr 1 ]apelin-13 was cleaved from both termini but the C-terminal was more susceptible to cleavage. Consequently, of the metabolites identified, [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-12) , [pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-10) and [pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1-6) were the most abundant. these data suggest that apelin peptides designed for use as cardiovascular therapeutics, should include modifications that minimise C-terminal cleavage.

2|chunk|Apelin is an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor, initially characterised from bovine stomach extracts as a 77-amino acid preproprotein 1 . The prepro-apelin is further cleaved into shorter but functional fragments including apelin-36, apelin-17, apelin-13 and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 that contain an evolutionary conserved 12-amino acid C-terminal 1-3 . [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 was subsequently identified as the most predominant isoform of the apelin family of peptides in the cardiovascular system 4,5 , and the major circulating form of the peptide 6 . In the cardiovascular system, apelin is the most potent endogenous inotropic agent yet identified 4 . Apelin modulates vascular tone in vivo, decreasing blood pressure when infused into rats and dilating resistance vessels when infused into human forearm 7-9 . In vitro, apelin causes nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation of human splanchnic artery 10 , although a nitric oxide-independent, prostanoid dependent vasodilation in humans has been reported 4 . Apelin acted as a vasoconstrictor in endothelium denuded vessels via a direct action on vascular smooth muscle cells whilst also acting as a potent angiogenic factor and mitogen of endothelial cells 4,11 . Based on these beneficial effects, apelin was proposed as a potential therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. For example, apelin administration showed cardioprotective effects in heart failure 12 , and ameliorated the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats 13,14 and humans 15 . In addition, the protective effects of apelin has been
