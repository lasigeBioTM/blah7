  <chunk id="38f12e7be8d0f29aabe77ac96fa19d62407c0898.c1" text="The genus Torovirus (order Nidovirales) includes a number of species that infect livestock. These viruses have a linear positive-sense ssRNA genome of ~25-30 kb, encoding a large polyprotein that is expressed from the genomic RNA, and several additional proteins expressed from a nested set of 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. In this brief report, we describe the bioinformatic discovery of a new, apparently coding, ORF that overlaps the 5' end of the polyprotein coding sequence, ORF1a, in the +2 reading frame. The new ORF has a strong coding signature and, in fact, is more conserved at the amino acid level than the overlapping region of ORF1a. We propose that the new ORF utilizes a non-AUG initiation codon -namely a conserved CUG codon in a strong Kozak context -upstream of the ORF1a AUG initiation codon, resulting in a novel 258 amino acid protein, dubbed '30K'."/>
