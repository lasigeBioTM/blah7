    "text": "This study describes the experience and results of the vaccination strategies developed for tackling the measles outbreak in Cear\u00e1 State, Brazil, from December 2013 to September 2015. Strategies of routine vaccination, community immunity, and vaccination campaigns were conducted, along with searching of unvaccinated people, through rapid monitoring of immunization coverage and scanning. To describe the results, primary data collected in field activities and secondary data on vaccination in a population aged from six months to 49 years, available at the Information System of the National Immunization Program (IS-NIP), were used. The immunization coverage achieved was of >95%. However, this coverage is only administrative and may not represent reality, hence the importance of implementing the nominal information system of the National Immunization Program.",
