    "text": "The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of social distancing, the use of face masks and hand washing when leaving home among Brazilian adults aged 50 or over. Data from 6,149 telephone interviews were used, conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020 among participants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil). Social distancing was defined by not having left home in the last seven days. Only 32.8% of study participants did not leave home during the period considered, 36.3% left between one and two times, 15.2% between three and five times and 15.7% left every day. The main reasons for leaving home were to buy medicine or food (74.2%), to work (25.1%), to pay bills (24.5%), for health care (10.5%), to exercise (6.2%), and to meet family or friends (8.8%). Among those who left home, 97.3% always wore face masks and 97.3% always performed hand washing. Women left home less often than men. Men left home more often to work and exercise while women left home more often to seek healthcare. Men (odds ratio - OR = 1.84), those with higher education (OR = 1.48 and 1.95 for 5-8 and 9 years, respectively) and urban residents (OR = 1.54) left home more frequently to perform essential activities, regardless of age or other characteristics. Results show low adherence to social distancing, but high prevalence in the reported use of face masks and hand washing.",
