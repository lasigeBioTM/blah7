The incidence rate, lethality and number of cumulative daily cases were calculated.1,005 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified, most of them in Cear\u00e1 and Bahia states. The incidence rate was 1.8/100,000 inhabitants and lethality was 2.7%. Cear\u00e1 was the state with the highest number of cases, with 29.6 new cases per day on average. Average intensive care bed availability in the Northeast region (1.04/10,000 inhab.) was below the national average (2.8/10,000 inhab.).the indicators suggest that COVID-19 impact is heterogeneous and signal the challenges for health systems in the Northeast Region.",
