The incidence rate, lethality and number of cumulative daily cases were calculated.1,005 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified, most of them in Cear\u00e1 and Bahia states. The incidence rate was 1.8/100,000 inhabitants and lethality was 2.7%. Cear\u00e1 was the state with the highest number of cases, with 29.6 new cases per day on average. Average intensive care bed availability in the Northeast region (1.04/10,000 inhab.) was below the national average (2.8/10,000 inhab.).the indicators suggest that COVID-19 impact is heterogeneous and signal the challenges for health systems in the Northeast Region.","typesettings":[],"project":"ENG_NER_NEL","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":57,"end":63},"obj":"MESH:D006262"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":97,"end":105},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":187,"end":195},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":255,"end":261},"obj":"MESH:D006262"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":292,"end":301},"obj":"MESH:D015994"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":396,"end":404},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":466,"end":475},"obj":"MESH:D015994"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":791,"end":799},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":810,"end":823},"obj":"HP:0001425"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":854,"end":860},"obj":"MESH:D006262"}]}
