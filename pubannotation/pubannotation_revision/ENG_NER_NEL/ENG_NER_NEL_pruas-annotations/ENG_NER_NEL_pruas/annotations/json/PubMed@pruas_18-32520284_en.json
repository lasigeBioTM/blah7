The number of confirmed cases, as April 11, surpassed 1,700,000, but this figure does not reflect the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population as, in many countries, tests are almost exclusively performed in people with symptoms, particularly severe cases. To properly assess the magnitude of the problem and to contribute to the design of evidence-based policies for fighting COVID-19, one must accurately estimate the population prevalence of infection. Our study is aimed at estimating the prevalence of infected individuals in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to document how fast the infection spreads, and to estimate the proportion of infected persons who present or presented symptoms, as well as the proportion of asymptomatic infections. Four repeated serological surveys will be conducted in probability samples of nine sentinel cities every two weeks. Tests will be performed in 4,500 participants in each survey, totaling18,000 interviews. Interviews and tests will be conducted at the participants' household. A rapid test for the detection of antibodies will be used; the test was validated prior to the beginning of the fieldwork.","typesettings":[],"project":"ENG_NER_NEL_pruas","denotations":[{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"obj":"MESH:D000086382"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":14,"end":21},"obj":"MESH:D004194"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":14,"end":21},"obj":"DOID:4"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":38,"end":54},"obj":"MESH:D000086402"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":109,"end":134},"obj":"MESH:D014944"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":225,"end":233},"obj":"MESH:D058873"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":337,"end":347},"obj":"MESH:D015995"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":351,"end":359},"obj":"MESH:D000086382"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":351,"end":359},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":367,"end":377},"obj":"MESH:D011153"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":478,"end":484},"obj":"HP:0012828"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":612,"end":620},"obj":"MESH:D000086382"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":612,"end":620},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":655,"end":665},"obj":"MESH:D011153"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":666,"end":676},"obj":"MESH:D015995"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":728,"end":738},"obj":"MESH:D015995"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":965,"end":988},"obj":"MESH:D058345"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1023},"obj":"MESH:D000087124"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1056},"obj":"MESH:D011336"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1057,"end":1064},"obj":"MESH:D012494"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1082,"end":1088},"obj":"MESH:D002947"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1111},"obj":"MESH:D000087124"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1210,"end":1215},"obj":"MESH:D000087124"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1268,"end":1310},"obj":"MESH:D000087124"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1329,"end":1333},"obj":"MESH:D000087124"}]}
