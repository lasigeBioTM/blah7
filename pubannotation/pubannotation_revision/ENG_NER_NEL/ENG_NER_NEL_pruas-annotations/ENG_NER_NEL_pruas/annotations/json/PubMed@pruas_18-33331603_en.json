The time interval between symptom onset and testing was compared using the ANOVA test, classifying it according to test adequacy/timeliness.Taking 1,942,514 notifications, average time between symptom onset and testing was 10.2 days (\u00b117.1). Among those tested, females (55.1%), people aged 20-39 years (43.8%), and the Southeast region of Brazil (43.0%) predominated. 58.8% of IgM ELISA tests were performed at an adequate time while 68.0% of rapid antigen tests were not performed at an adequate time.Inadequacy was found between symptom onset and time taken to test for COVID-19 in the Brazilian regions.","typesettings":[],"project":"ENG_NER_NEL_pruas","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":37,"end":45},"obj":"MESH:D013577"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":45},"obj":"DOID:225"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":63,"end":67},"obj":"MESH:D013995"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":85,"end":102},"obj":"HP:0003674"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":119,"end":127},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":119,"end":127},"obj":"HP:0033141"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":119,"end":127},"obj":"MESH:D000086382"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":167,"end":174},"obj":"MESH:D011996"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":187,"end":195},"obj":"MESH:D013577"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":187,"end":195},"obj":"DOID:225"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":224,"end":232},"obj":"HP:0033141"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":224,"end":232},"obj":"MESH:D000086382"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":224,"end":232},"obj":"DOID:0080600"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":344,"end":349},"obj":"DOID:0080327"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":386,"end":390},"obj":"MESH:D013995"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":408,"end":421},"obj":"HP:0003674"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":562,"end":566},"obj":"MESH:D013995"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":575,"end":588},"obj":"HP:0003674"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":668,"end":672},"obj":"MESH:D000368"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":722,"end":728},"obj":"MESH:D001938"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"MESH:D013995"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":826,"end":845},"obj":"MESH:D000086742"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":832,"end":839},"obj":"CHEBI:59132"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":880,"end":884},"obj":"MESH:D013995"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":914,"end":927},"obj":"HP:0003674"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":932,"end":936},"obj":"MESH:D013995"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":946,"end":963},"obj":"MESH:D000086742"}]}
