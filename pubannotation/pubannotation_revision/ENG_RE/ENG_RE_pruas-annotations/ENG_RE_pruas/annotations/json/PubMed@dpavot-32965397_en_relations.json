We conducted a survey of medical visits from March 23, 2020 (when local commerce was closed) to April 23, 2020 (P20), in comparison with the same period in 2019 (P19).We found decreases in the number of cardiology consultations, exercise tests, Holter, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram (90%, 84%, 94%, 92%, 94%, and 81%, respectively). In relation to cardiac surgery and cardiac catheterization, there were 48% and 60% decreases, respectively. There was an increase in the number of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (33%) and definitive pacemaker implantations (29%). There were 97 admissions to the ICU during P19, in contrast with 78 during P20, a 20% decrease. Visits to the cardiac emergency room (45%) and admissions to the cardiology ward (36%) also decreased. The decrease in oncology consultations was 30%. Chemotherapy sessions decreased from 1,944 to 1,066 (45%), and radiotherapy sessions decreased by 19%.COVID-19 has led to a considerable decrease in the number of consultations in outpatient clinics for cardiology, oncology, and other specialties. There was a concerning decrease in the number of cardiac surgeries, chemotherapy sessions, and radiotherapy sessions during the initial weeks of the pandemic. The number of people seeking care in the cardiac emergency room and the number of admissions to the cardiology ward and ICU also decreased, generating concern regarding the evolution and prognosis of these patients with pathologies other than COVID-19 during this pandemic time.
