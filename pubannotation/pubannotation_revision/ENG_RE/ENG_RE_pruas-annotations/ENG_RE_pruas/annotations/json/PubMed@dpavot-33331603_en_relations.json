The time interval between symptom onset and testing was compared using the ANOVA test, classifying it according to test adequacy/timeliness.Taking 1,942,514 notifications, average time between symptom onset and testing was 10.2 days (\u00b117.1). Among those tested, females (55.1%), people aged 20-39 years (43.8%), and the Southeast region of Brazil (43.0%) predominated. 58.8% of IgM ELISA tests were performed at an adequate time while 68.0% of rapid antigen tests were not performed at an adequate time.Inadequacy was found between symptom onset and time taken to test for COVID-19 in the Brazilian regions.","typesettings":[],"project":"ENG_RE_pruas","denotations":[{"id":"T0","span":{"begin":37,"end":45},"obj":"DOID_225"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":85,"end":102},"obj":"HP_0003674"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":119,"end":127},"obj":"HP_0033141"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":119,"end":127},"obj":"DOID_0080600"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":187,"end":195},"obj":"DOID_225"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":224,"end":232},"obj":"HP_0033141"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":224,"end":232},"obj":"DOID_0080600"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":408,"end":421},"obj":"HP_0003674"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":575,"end":588},"obj":"HP_0003674"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":832,"end":839},"obj":"CHEBI_59132"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":914,"end":927},"obj":"HP_0003674"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":955,"end":963},"obj":"HP_0033141"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":955,"end":963},"obj":"DOID_0080600"}],"relations":[{"id":"R0","pred":"effect","subj":"T0","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R1","pred":"effect","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"effect","subj":"T3","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"effect","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"}]}
